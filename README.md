Checkers
========
Simple CLI game of checkers, using simple minimax AI.


To enter a move, first enter the coordinates of the piece you want to move, 
then choose which direction to move using the characters 'q' for forward left, 
'w' for forward right, 'a' for back left, and 's' for back right (only kings can move back). 
Capitalize the direction letter to initiate a jump.  
If one or more jumps are possible, you must jump. 
If you start a multiple-jump, you must keep jumping until it is impossible to do so.
In order to initiate multi-jump, enter the directions of the jumps in order.  

Don't enter any commands that are too stupid or the game will crash.

Example moves: 

F1w  
G2Q 
D3WQ
